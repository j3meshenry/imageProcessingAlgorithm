The .m file is a MATLAB File I made, where I recreated used image processing techniques to apply Sobel Operator. 

## How it works: 
- Takes any input image
- Grayscales the input image (turns it into B&W)
- Binarizes the grayscaled image (turns dark into 1 and white into 0)
- Allows the user to mask/cutout a region of interest
-
